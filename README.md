### Project Five - 100DaysofCode
# QR Code with Python
This is a simple program that collects an input *data* from the user and encodes it to make a QR Code file.  

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import required library(s).
3. Create a variable to collect the text *data* to be encoded.
4. Create a variable to hold the image file of the encoded text.
5. Use the save function to save the encoded image file in a specific directory.
6. Stop.

## What I've learnt
* This program introduced me to the python library qrcode.
* I applied the use of backslash characters and input to collect data (text) from the user.
* When using python, directories or file path should always be with forward slashes.
